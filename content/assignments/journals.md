# Course Assignment: Sound Journals

## Objective
Conduct a detailed aural analysis of a single commercially available audio production that you admire for its sound quality. This assignment will deepen your understanding of audio engineering principles and enhance your critical listening skills.

## Assignment Details

### Submission Requirements
**Written Analysis**:
   - Compose a three-paragraph analysis focusing on the recording and production aspects of your selected audio piece.

**In-Class Presentation**:
   - Two students will present each Tuesday.
   - Prepare a 15-minute presentation to discuss your analysis.
   - Bring a representative sound example from your selected piece to play during the presentation.

### Purpose of the Assignment
Sharpening your aural skills is crucial for mastering the art of sound production. Through regular analysis of various musical works, genres, and recordings, you'll learn to notice nuanced differences in instruments, recording environments, microphones, and production techniques. These journals will cultivate a professional understanding and appreciation of audio productions, enhancing your ability to discern and articulate the intricacies of sound.

### Assignment Guidelines

#### Selection of Music Piece
- Choose a piece of music that you admire for its production quality.
- Limit your discussion to a specific single piece, like a song, rather than an entire album.

#### Sound Example
- Provide a short audio clip (no longer than 30 seconds) that best represents the production quality of your chosen piece.
- **Format requirement**: The audio file must be uncompressed (e.g., WAV, AIFF, FLAC). Do not use MP3 or other lossy compressed formats.
- Where to find high-quality audio: [Best Stores for Buying Digital Music You Can Keep Forever](https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-sites-to-buy-mp3-and-digital-music-you-own-forever/) 

#### Focus of Discussion
- Direct your analysis towards recording and production techniques rather than musical elements such as harmony or rhythm.

#### Background Information
Include essential details about the production in your analysis and presentation:
- The recording's date and location.
- Key individuals involved, including the performing musicians, producer, and engineer.

#### Aural Analysis
Conduct a thorough aural analysis of your chosen piece:
- Use the European Broadcast Union's [Assessment methods for the subjective evaluation of the quality of sound programme material – Music](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3286.pdf) as a guide for your analysis.
- Refer to Chapter 7 (Analysis of Sound from Electroacoustic Sources) in the Corey textbook for additional guidance.
- Address specific aspects of the production: original use of sound parameters, standout production elements, or unique studio production techniques.
- Research or speculate creatively about how certain sounds or effects were achieved in the recording.

### Presentation Format

#### Scheduling
- Two students will present each Tuesday.
  
#### Presentation Guidelines
- Keep your presentation under 15 minutes.
- Do not prepare slides.
- Bring your written analysis and a device to play your sound example.
- Begin by playing your sound example and highlighting a particular aspect of the recording for the class to focus on.
- Use the sound example to lead into your discussion.

### Assessment Criteria
Your assignment will be evaluated based on:
- The creativity and detail in your analysis.
- Your ability to articulate what you appreciate about the production.
- The depth of your conclusions about how certain production qualities were achieved.
- The thoroughness of your aural analysis, even if reliable information about the production is limited or unavailable.

Approach this assignment with an inquisitive mind and a keen ear. Combine thorough research with creative speculation to deliver a compelling and insightful analysis.
