## Introduction to Spectral Balance

- Spectral balance refers to the relative level of frequency bands across the audible range (20 Hz - 20 kHz).
- A “flat” spectral balance is a reference ideal: roughly even relative level across the spectrum.
- Understanding spectral balance helps improve clarity and tonal balance in recordings.

{{% note %}}

- Prompt: “Does this feel boomy, thin, harsh, dull, or mid-heavy?”
- Emphasize: “flat” is a useful reference, not a goal for every genre.
- Goal: identify bands that dominate or disappear, then decide if that is intentional.

## Levels of Perspective in Spectral Analysis

- Different levels of detail reveal unique aspects of a recording.
- Allows a multi-dimensional view of sound material.
- Listening and visual analysis tools help evaluate spectral distribution.

{{% note %}}

- Frame it as “zoom levels”: overall contour → band areas → narrow resonances.
- Prompt: “What do you hear first?” then “What does the analyzer confirm or contradict?”

## Subjective Analysis of Spectral Balance

- Holistic listening is crucial for understanding balance.
- Identify prominent (over-represented) or deficient (under-represented) frequency bands.
- Detect resonances and their approximate frequencies.
- Ensure instrument levels align with the intended musical style.

{{% note %}}

- Prompt: “What’s masking what?” (e.g., vocal vs. guitars; kick vs. bass).
- Reminder: if you can name the problem in words, you can usually find it in frequency space.

## Evaluating Overall Bandwidth

- Check if the recording covers the full range (20 Hz - 20 kHz).
- Identify whether the recording is band-limited.
- Overtones from cymbals and brass instruments extend to 20 kHz.

{{% note %}}

- Caution: “full range” depends on medium/era (e.g., old recordings, lo-fi aesthetics).
- Prompt: “Is the air missing, or is it intentionally filtered?”

## What to Listen For in Spectral Balance

- Is the overall tone bright, dark, mid-forward, or scooped?
- Do certain bands feel harsh, muddy, boxy, or hollow?
- Does the balance support the genre and the lead element?

{{% note %}}

- Translate adjectives → likely bands (rough anchors): boomy (60–120), muddy (200–400), boxy (400–800), harsh (2–5k), dull (8k+).
- Emphasize: EQ is one tool; arrangement, dynamics, and level are also “spectral decisions.”

## Assessing Overall Balance

- Determine whether different sound sources are balanced correctly.
- Identify if any element is too dominant or too weak.

{{% note %}}

- Prompt: “What is the ‘main message’ of this mix, and is it audible at all times?”
- If something feels unclear, check masking before reaching for more level.

## Comparing with Reference Sounds

- Use reference recordings from the same genre.
- Helps establish a benchmark for timbral goals.
- Guides production and mixing decisions.

{{% note %}}

- Tip: level-match references before comparing (louder often seems “better”).
- Ask: “What is similar?” (instrumentation, arrangement, era, loudness target)

## Tools for Spectral Analysis

- **Real-time spectral analyzers**: Provide a visual representation of frequency content.
  - Examples (REAPER): TB Spectrogram, Spectrogram (JSFX), Spectral Peaks.
- **Tonal balance meters**: Compare the overall spectral contour against a target range.
- **Reference track workflow**: Level-matched A/B comparisons in the same genre.
- **Band-isolation listening**: EQ/bandpass filters or spectral edits to hear a specific region.

{{% note %}}

- Demo idea: isolate a narrow band (EQ/bandpass or spectral edits), then listen for what “lives” there.
- Reminder: tools show energy, not “good/bad” by themselves—interpret in context and level-match when comparing.

## Aesthetic Considerations in Spectral Balance

- Aim to highlight desirable sonic qualities.
- Consider how the recording compares to a live experience.
- Address spectral imbalances that impact clarity.

{{% note %}}

- Prompt: “Do we want ‘hyper-real’ studio clarity, or a live-like blend?”
- Tie to style: what counts as “clear” in EDM vs. jazz vs. punk is different.

## Bridge: Spectral Balance ↔ Timbre

- **Spectral balance** describes the *mix-level* distribution of energy across frequency bands.
- **Timbre** is the *source-level* sound quality we perceive (beyond pitch and loudness).
- Timbre is shaped by:
  - **Spectrum / spectral envelope** (which bands are present and emphasized)
  - **Dynamic envelope** (attack, sustain, decay)
  - **Noise/inharmonic content** (breath, buzz, distortion, room)

{{% note %}}
- One sentence: “When we adjust spectral balance, we often change timbre—either of one sound or the whole mix.”
- Prompt: “What would change about a vocal’s timbre if we cut 300 Hz or boost 10 kHz?”

## Defining Timbre

- **Perceived sound quality** beyond pitch and loudness.
- Often **defined by contrast**: what makes similar sounds distinct.
- **Two key aspects**:
  1. **Overall quality** (representation, affect, etc.).
  2. **Acoustic content** (spectrum, spectral envelope, dynamics).

{{% note %}}
- Timbre shapes how we recognize and categorize sound.
- It conveys information about a source beyond musical notes.
- Acoustic content provides measurable data to analyze its structure.
- Link: in this deck, “overall quality” roughly aligns with character, and “acoustic content” aligns with content.

## Analyzing Timbre in a Recording

- Consider **content (acoustic features)**, **character (perceptual descriptors)**, and **manifestation (how the recording chain/mix presents it)**.
- Timbre lacks a single, universally shared analytical vocabulary.
- Examine **component parts** in relation to the whole.

{{% note %}}
- Quick definitions:
  - Content (acoustic features): spectrum/spectral envelope, dynamic envelope (attack/decay), harmonic vs. noise components, modulation/articulation.
  - Character (perceptual descriptors): bright/dark, warm/thin, harsh/smooth, breathy/clear, gritty/clean, intimate/distant.
  - Manifestation (in this recording): how performance + instrument + mic/room + placement + processing (EQ/comp/saturation/reverb) + mix context (masking/stereo) shape what we hear.
- Link: this content/character split is what the next slide calls **dual information streams**.
- Prompt: “What makes this sound recognizable even if the notes are the same?”
- Emphasize: we’re building a shared class vocabulary, not finding the one “correct” label.

## General Approaches to Timbre Analysis

- **Two Levels of Perspective**: individual sound vs. sound source (instrument/voice).
- **Dual Information Streams**: character (expressive) and content (physical/acoustic).
- **Sound Object**: analyze a sound “as itself,” out of musical context.
- **Deep Listening**: repeated, focused listening for small differences.

{{% note %}}
- Quick expansions:
  - Two levels of perspective:
    - Individual sound = “what is this event?” (its envelope, spectrum, noisiness, motion).
    - Sound source = “what made it?” (instrument/voice identity, technique, material, space).
  - Dual information streams:
    - Content = what we can point to/measure (bands, envelope shape, harmonic/noise mix).
    - Character = how it reads to listeners (bright, warm, nasal, brittle, airy, etc.).
  - Sound object:
    - Temporarily ignore musical role (“melody,” “accompaniment”) and describe the sound itself.
    - Useful for avoiding assumption/labeling too early.
  - Deep listening:
    - Repeat small excerpts; change only one variable (solo vs. in mix, mono vs. stereo, level-matched A/B).
    - Goal: notice *small* differences consistently, not just big ones.
- Prompts:
  - “Describe without naming the instrument first.”
  - “What would you change (content) to get a different character?”

## Key Components of Timbre Analysis

- **Dynamic Envelope**: Shape and changes over time.
- **Spectral Content**: Frequencies present in a sound.
- **Spectral Envelope**: The overall “shape” of energy across frequency (and how that shape changes over time).
- **Pitch Definition**: Presence and clarity of pitch.

{{% note %}}
- These components are mostly “content” (physical/acoustic), but we use them to support “character” (perceptual) descriptions.
- Spectral data and dynamic shape help define timbral uniqueness.
- Understanding pitch definition adds depth to timbral perception.

## Process of Timbre Analysis

1. **Isolate the Sound**: Consider as a discrete object.
2. **Observe & Evaluate**: Dynamic envelope, spectral content, spectral envelope.
3. **Describe**: Use objective terminology for analysis.

{{% note %}}
- Isolating a sound provides the clearest insight into its timbre.
- Observation refines analytical accuracy.
- Using shared language ensures meaningful discussion of timbre.
