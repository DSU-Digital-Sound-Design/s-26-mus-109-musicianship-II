## Understanding Bandwidth

- Audio Frequency Range:
  - Full Spectrum: 20 Hz - 20 kHz
  - Musical Content:
    - Fundamentals (up to 4 kHz)
    - Overtones (up to 20 kHz)
- Bandwidth Factors:
  - Recording medium
  - System components
  - Digital compression
  - Filtering effects

{{% note %}}

- Overall bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies a recording encompasses, typically from the lowest bass at 20 Hz to the highest treble at 20 kHz. Analyzing this reveals the fullness and richness of a recording.
- The bandwidth can be limited by factors such as the recording medium, sound system components, or purposeful down-sampling in digital formats to save on data transmission, each impacting the audio quality uniquely.
- The effects of narrowed bandwidth are perceptible and can be analyzed through the use of high-pass and low-pass filters, which cut off frequencies beyond certain thresholds.
- In evaluating high-frequency extension, it's crucial to consider the presence of overtones, especially since musical fundamentals generally don't exceed 4,000 Hz, yet overtones from instruments like cymbals and brass can reach up to 20,000 Hz, significantly contributing to the richness and texture of the sound.

## The Auditory Image & Stereo Field

- Creating Spatial Perception:
  - Mental representation from audio cues
  - Phantom image creation
  - Interchannel time/amplitude control
- Production Conventions:
  - Center: vocals, bass, kick
  - Sides: instruments for width
  - Depth through processing
- Analysis Elements:
  - Image width & stability
  - Source placement
  - Spatial distribution

{{% note %}}

- The auditory image is a listener's mental representation of the external world based on auditory input, allowing localization of sound sources even when they are phantom images created between actual loudspeakers.
- The stereo image is crafted by manipulating interchannel amplitude and time differences, creating an illusion of sound source locations between two loudspeakers. This process doesn't mimic natural hearing due to the phantom image effect.
- Conventions in music production, like those in pop and rock, utilize the stereo image in specific ways, often emphasizing the center for critical elements like vocals and bass, with other instruments panned to create balance and depth.
- Analyzing a stereo image involves assessing its width, the placement and stability of sound sources, and the spatial distribution of these sources, all contributing to the clarity, balance, and overall impact of the recording.
