## Why Evaluate Sound?

- **Document** — Record sound characteristics for future reference
- **Plan** — Define desired outcomes before recording
- **Collaborate** — Understand and share ideas with peers
- **Replicate** — Recreate specific sounds and styles

{{% note %}}

- Sound evaluation provides detailed documentation of sound characteristics and project insights—invaluable for future reference and building upon past work
- Essential in the planning stages of recording projects, especially outside the studio, where understanding desired sound outcomes is key
- Offers deeper insights into collaborative work, helping professionals understand and integrate ideas from colleagues and collaborators
- The ability to replicate and adapt specific sounds and styles is a fundamental skill in audio production—sound evaluation is central to mastering this

## How We Describe Sound

- **Sensory** — warm, sharp, smooth, harsh
- **Emotional** — soothing, jarring, euphoric, melancholic
- **Spatial** — wide, deep, flat, layered
- **Dynamic** — soft, loud, subtle, intense

{{% note %}}

- Sound vocabulary is unique and less standardized compared to frameworks like music theory
- Includes metaphorical or descriptive terms linking sound to sensory experiences, emotions, spatial perceptions, and dynamics
- Sensory descriptors ("warm," "sharp," "smooth," "harsh") convey how sound feels on a sensory level
- Emotional terms ("soothing," "jarring," "euphoric," "melancholic") reflect the emotional effect on the listener
- Spatial references ("wide," "deep," "flat," "layered") convey perceived spatial qualities
- Intensity and dynamics terms ("soft," "loud," "subtle," "intense") describe volume and dynamic range—crucial for understanding impact and presence

## The Problem with Subjective Terms

- **No universal standard** — "warm" means different things to different people
- **Cultural differences** — instrument and mood references vary across backgrounds
- **Personal bias** — emotional terms like "somber" or "joyful" are subjective

{{% note %}}

- Metaphorical and subjective terms present challenges in describing sound
- Interpretation varies significantly among people—"warm," "sharp," or "smooth" evoke different qualities for different listeners with no universal standard
- Cultural and personal differences play a significant role
- Describing sound by referencing specific instruments or moods can be misleading across cultural backgrounds
- Terms describing mood ("somber," "happy") are heavily influenced by personal and cultural contexts
- Difficult to convey consistent meaning across different listeners

## Strategies for Clearer Communication

- **Use measurable attributes** — frequency, amplitude, timbre
- **Show visual tools** — graphs, spectrograms
- **Apply standard terminology** — technical terms from acoustics
- **Provide examples** — real-world sound samples

{{% note %}}

- Focus on physical, measurable characteristics for more effective and accurate communication
- Discuss quantifiable aspects (frequency, amplitude, timbre) for objective and clear understanding
- Graphical representations (graphs, spectrograms) offer detailed, exact depiction of sound characteristics
- Standardized terminology from acoustics and audio engineering minimizes ambiguity
- Real-world examples or sound samples illustrate specific qualities effectively
- Makes communication more relatable and understandable for diverse audiences
